The goal of this project is working with a UX/UI team to improve the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) due to a A|B testing from an e-commerce that UX/UI team built from zero. 

*Desnivel*, the oldest library in Spain, specialized in travelling, adventure and mountains, wants to rise the internet sales and the UX/UI team is working on the webpage. For this purpose, the team gets in touch with the Data team for looking for a way to improve the sales with the webpage. Data team offers a A|B testing for this so it UX/UI team proposes two ways to access to the product:

**Control**

**Test**

They have not too much time so they have to get quickly data about control and test. Everyone works on the study and asking people for buying a literature book about cycle touring called 'Giro de Italia'. Teams count the taken time for them to get the purchase and note the issues people find during the process. Finally, 11 people are interviewed for control and 10 people are interviewed for test.
