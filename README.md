The goal of this project is working with a UX/UI team to improve the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) due to a A|B testing from an e-commerce that UX/UI team built from zero.

*Desnivel*, the oldest library in Spain, specialized in travelling, adventure and mountains, wants to rise the internet sales and the UX/UI team is working on the webpage. For this purpose, the team gets in touch with the Data team for looking for a way to improve the sales with the webpage. Data team offers an A|B testing for this so UX/UI team proposes two ways to access to the product:

**Control** ✏

**Test** 🧪

They have not too much time so they have to get data quickly about control and test. Everyone works on the study and asks people for buying a literature book about cycle touring 🚴‍♀️ called 'Giro de Italia'. Teams count the taken time for them to get the purchase and note the issues that people find during the process. Finally, 11 people are interviewed for control and 10 people are interviewed for test.

Due to everybody "bought the book" 💰 (just for testing), we stablished the mean time for every test (control and test) as the limit to difference if the buy the book (less than the mean value) or they do not buy the book (more than the mean value). In the study, 65 seconds was the control mean time and 67 seconds was the test mean time (final restriction time: 60s) ⌛ .

Owing to Bayesian statistics, we could stablish the Conversion Rate:
- 57 ± 13 % for control
- 38 ± 13 % for test

To support that control was more effective than the test, we estimated the effectivity rate 📈 and we got a 48 % more effectiviness from control respecting to test with a 84% probability where only a 58% found and bought the book before one minute on control and a 36% for test.

In addition, we found some issues to fix and improve the user experience:
- Change the filter button with an automatic selection (we save one click) 🖱
- Extend the credit card option click to all button and not only the selection circle 💳
- Make more visible the cards when buying (they stay on the top and it is not visible if user scrolls the web) 📚

Thanks to these changes, both teams improved the sales in *Desnivel*.
